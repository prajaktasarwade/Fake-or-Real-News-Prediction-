- Project Objective

This machine learning model is built for predicting the news whether it is real or fake using logistic regression.

- Task

 1. Data preprocessing
     – Handled NA values.
     – Used Stopword to remove the words which is not adding the value in sentence.
     – Used Stemming to reduced the word into its root word.
    
2. Feature Extraction - Vectorizer to convert the text data into numerical data.
3. checked the accuracy of model using accuracy score.

- Library Used Python, Numpy and Pandas, nltk, stopword, PorterStemmer, TfidfVectorizer, Logistic Regression, accuracy score, Sklearn for model building.
